<h2>About</h2>
<strong>FILL THIS IN</strong><br/>
Answer these questions: What is your project? Why'd you build it?l
My project is a security system, where using simple arduino and sensor to basically check if people are coming towards the door, and using a controller to let them in. I originally built it because one of my robotics mentors in electrionics continued to give me ideas on what I can do for my project, where he introduced me to the arduino. From then on, I continued to research on different ways it can be used, eventually getting to the ultrasonic sensor and the new ring system my mom bought recently.

<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>
<strong>My Goal is to be able to achieve this security system, not as good as an actual one since it is very simplified, but to just make it work and presentable.</strong><br/>
 Summarize your goals, non-goals, and project requirements from your design doc. Make sure to link your design doc here as well.
 
 <h3>Sprint Goal</h3>
<strong> My goal for this week is to be able to finish connecting my hardware together wiring wise as well as finish the individual code to be able to connect them together.</strong><br/>

<h2>Key learnings</h2>
<strong>I learned about arduino in general, and also realized how frustrating hardware is with software. I also have been quite lazy with it, but will continue and try to finish. The wiring is really tough as well, 
having to connect everything into one arduino. UPDATE: I was able to successfully connect everything, also being able to connect everything to the arduino. I also learned about the different ways an arduino can connect to the software and code with also being able to make so many things work, as well as learning a new language in C++, even if its just the arduino hardware parts to it.</strong><br/>

<h2>Running your project</h2>
<strong>To run this project, you need to open up the main code of the arduino, plug in the usb into port 3 of the laptop, and press upload.</strong><br/>
How would I, or anyone who comes across this project, run this project? Make sure to include all the steps.

<h2>Misc.</h2>
I honestly havent pushed any of my code into Git hub because I kinda forgot. Im really sorry. I will however starting now upload my code and continue to commit and push. UPDATE: I committed and pushed my code, which was finished for quite a bit, not many corrections just little bits of trail and error and suffering :(((.
