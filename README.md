 <h3>Sprint Goal</h3>
<strong> My goal for this week is to be able to finish connecting my hardware together wiring wise as well as finish the individual code to be able to connect them together.</strong><br/>

<h2>Key learnings</h2>
<strong>I learned about arduino in general, and also realized how frustrating hardware is with software. I also have been quite lazy with it, but will continue and try to finish. The wiring is really tough as well, 
having to connect everything into one arduino.</strong><br/>
So... what did you learn? (start this, but **come back to it at the end of the sprint**)

<h2>Running your project</h2>
